# Load and Spool Example
In this example we will start by creating a simple project that executes two shell scripts. We will not be using any design tool but rather build the entire project from scratch and execute it using **Precision100**. We will be using [Github](https://github.com) as a `repository` for this project. If you don't have an account there, you should get it before going any further. We will calling our project rather unimaginatively "the longer example", with that lets get started.

## Prerequisities
To create and execute the project you need to have the following,

1. A [Github](https://www.github.com) account
2. Git client installed on your machine.

You can find many tutorials and videos to install Git on your operating system. e.g. you can look at [this one from Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git) or [this from the Git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

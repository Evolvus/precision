# Load and Spool Example
In this example, We will create a project to Create a table in a staging area, Load data into it  and then spool the data into a file. To achieve these tasks we will use the *sql-plus*, *loader* and the *spool* operator and learn about them. We will also learn a little about how **Precision 100** makes use of environment variables and also a little about `precision-native` client. 

We will use Github as a repository for this project.

## Prerequisities
To create and execute the project you need to have the following,

1. A [Github](https://www.github.com) account
2. Git client installed on your machine.
3. A running *Oracle* database with a schema named *Precision*
4. A working *sql plus* client
5. A working *sql loader* client

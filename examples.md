# Precision 100 Examples

The best way to learn the **Precision 100** framework is to go through the examples. The examples start off with the "[the-empty-project](./the-empty-project.md)" all the way to some of the migration use cases where the framework is used.

1. [The Empty Project](./the-empty-project.md)
2. [The Longer Example](./the-longer-example.md)
3. [Load and Spool](./load-and-spool.md)
